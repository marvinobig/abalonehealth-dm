# Abalone Health Investigation Report


##### Figure 1.1 - exploring the datasets

The two datasets for the Abalone populations (2020 and 2021) used in the investigation have columns that include sex, length (mm), diameter (mm), height (mm), whole weight (g) which represents the total weight of the abalone, shucked weight (g) which represents the
weight of the abalone meat without its shell, sell weight (g) which represents the weight of the abalone's shell and spots which represents the number of spots or rings on the abalone
shell.

## Summary Statistics

##### Figure 1.2 - Info() on datasets

##### Figure 1.3 - describe() on datasets

The datasets were further explored using describe() and info() methods and then the distributions of different features like Length, Diameter, and others were visualized using a histogram plot for the numerical columns and a bar chart for the gender column.

##### Figure 1.5 - bar chart plot used on the gender column

The above helped to reveal any oddities in the data as seen with the sex column having an extra category or the greater range of data in the height column within the 2020 dataset.
